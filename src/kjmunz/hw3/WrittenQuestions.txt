Q1. The empirical evidence DOES support the claim!
On one run of the trails this data was present:
N	MaxComp		MaxExch
16	26.0		13.0
32	55.0		28.0
64	117.0		51.0
128	238.0		103.0
256	489.0		200.0
512	972.0		401.0
As seen, MaxComp never exceeds 2*N and MaxExch never exceeds N. This is true of all the trials I ran.
